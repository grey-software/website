To ensure that the organization’s future revenues went towards our mission

## How is Grey Software different from other educational sites, such as Udemy, Udacity, and Coursera?

These websites host educational content that many rely on, including Grey
Software's mentors and students.

Our mentors teach by collaborating with individuals or small groups on
real-world projects using the same open-source technologies that are used in the
industry.

## How does Grey Software deliver its educational content?

Grey Software hosts students who collaborate with mentors to build our open
-source products in a real-world software development environment with mentors.

Since we create our apps and teach students how to develop them simultaneously,
it’s hard to define a structured curriculum and predict learning outcomes.

We therefore propose that each project have creation teams and education teams.

The creation team evolves our products using the latest, most productive
technologies and trends in software development.

The education team turns our products into projects that students can learn
from. This team abstracts away certain software complexities, allowing students
to gradually make their way to working with production code.

## How does Grey Software make money?

_Current_

We currently offer an Apprentice program where we teach students how to
contribute to our open source software.

_Future_

We’ve published our analytics openly at org.grey.software/stats, and we’re
looking to partner with advertisers to run ethical ads on our public apps.

We’re setting up software sales using Cryptolens, which would allow users to
purchase premium licenses to Grey Software’s apps and use it ad-free.

We’re looking into startup funding for our projects like Material Math and
Toonin, which have the potential to be useful deployed software.

We collect donations from individuals who believe in our mission through Paypal
and Github Sponsors.

## Does open source software kill competition?

Open sourcing your software doesn’t prevent competitors from creating software
similar in functionality but different in implementation.
